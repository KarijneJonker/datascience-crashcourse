Tukey forged links to the engineering and computer science communities (he coined the terms bit, short for binary digit, and software), and his original tenets are suprisingly durable and form part of the foundation for data science. The field of exploratory data analysis was established with Tukey’s 1977 now-classic book Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
